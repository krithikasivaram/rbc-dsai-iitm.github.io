abstract: As a part of the Industrial Internet Centre of Excellence at IIT Madras, GE and IITM are collaborating to develop a Digital Twin of an Aluminum Smelter potline using advanced software and data analytics. The digital twin is a live, virtual model of a physical system that is personalized & continuously learning from new data. Physics based models & artificial intelligence technologies, along with domain understanding make this possible,Signed about a year ago, the joint team has made significant progress on first principles physics based models. Going ahead, model predictive control algorithm and process monitoring will also be developed to be integrated for the digital twin.
